# Final Project

My final project will be to simultaneously stream audio between two computers. The goal of this would be to enable real-time audio communication, useful either in radio "on location" broadcasts, or just as "walkie-talkies".

I would likely experiment with either VLC or Icecast as streaming platforms, both as open-source, multi-platform, and widely used.

## Considerations

* How will I ensure security between both computers? (i.e., how do I make sure that only the two computers can access the stream?)

* How can I prevent cross-talk?

* Can I control the source of the audio? (i.e., switch between microphone, system audio, play a particular file, etc.)
